# Graduation Work â€” Inclusive Writing on the Internet.
## What is this ?
This is a graduation project for my final year at HEAJ in Namur, Belgium.
This project consists in a simple but contextualised tool that could help french speakers to include gender-neutral grammar within their articles and texts.

## Why is this ?

First of all, this tool is supposed to help everyone have an easier and more practical time with the so-called 'inclusive french', which has been causing some trouble since its modern inception due to the difficulty and impracticality that come with it : poor access to characters, unsupported text-to-speech by many popular characters, and so forth.
